# Exercise-3: Calling built-in functions

# Create a variable `my.name` that contains your name
my.name <- "SAM"

# Create a variable `name.length` that holds how many letters are in your name (use the `nchars()` function)
name.length<- nchar("SAM")

# Print the number of letters in your name
print(name, length)

# Create a variable `now.doing` that is your named followed by "is programming!" to the end of your name
# (use the `paste()` function)
now.doing<-paste

# Make the `now.doing` variable upper case


### Bonus

# Pick two of your favorite numbers (between 1 and 100) and assign them to `fav.1` and `fav.2`


# Divide each number by the square root of 201 and save it as the same variable


# Create a variable `raw.sum` that is the sum of those two variables. Use the `sum()` function for practice


# Create a variable `round.sum` that is the `raw.sum` rounded to 1 decimal place. Use the `round()` function


# Create two new variables `round.1` and `round.2` that are your `fav.1` and `fav.2` variables rounded
# to 1 decimal place


# Create a variable `sum.round` that is the sum of the rounded values


# Which is bigger, `round.sum` or `sum.round`? (You can use the `max()` function!)
